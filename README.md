# flavio lecture

This is a collection of interactive [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks used for a lecture about [flavio](https://flav-io.github.io/) - a Python package for flavour physics and other precision tests of the Standard Model. It makes use of the [RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE) plugin for presentation based on [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/).

Thanks to [Binder](https://mybinder.org/), you can run the notebooks in your browser without needing to install anything. Just click on "launch binder" above, and the first `1 Installation.ipynb` notebook will open automatically.

Help about navigating the presentation can be found in the [RISE documentation](https://damianavila.github.io/RISE/).

These Jupyter notebooks were prepared by Peter Stangl for a lecture on flavio and are based on a [tutorial originally written by David M. Straub](https://github.com/DavidMStraub/flavio-tutorial).
